  abstractNote = {Social media research is currently confronted with a
                  data-sharing problem, as social media platforms
                  prohibit full data distribution in their terms of
                  service. Until recent changes to the platform,
                  Twitter was an exception, allowing academics to
                  legally share Tweet and user IDs with peers, which
                  could then be re-collected using the Academic API
                  endpoints. This work investigates how Twitter data
                  is currently shared in two domains of harmful online
                  communication - abusive language and social bot
                  detection. We find that the currently frequently
                  utilized intermediate strategy of sharing Twitter
                  IDs suffers from substantial data loss, leading to
                  the incomparability of computational
                  results. Moreover, recent changes in the API result
                  in additional expenses and an increased collection
                  time that may have an impact on the feasibility of
                  research projects. All of these aspects further fuel
                  the reproducibility crisis that social media
                  analytics currently faces. To improve the current
                  situation, we propose several best practices for
                  research projects utilizing ID-based datasets for
                  their experiments and provide recommendations for
                  researchers who want to share their Twitter data
                  with peers.}
