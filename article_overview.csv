But it is not possible to make it run till the end. The perplexity scores are off; probably due to the random seed used for generating `separator` is missing.

There are so many unknown variables pop out of nowhere in the other two scripts, e.g. rt.subset, df_wide, df_long. Also, all the code and data related to the validation procedure is missing. It is impossible to know which 40 topics are excluded from their 200-topic LDA model. Thus, the verdict is that this study is mostly not reproducible, due to code quality issues.

TYPO: In Figure 1, it states that there are only 2066 abstracts; it should be 20664.

The data is deposit to Google Drive. I don't count this as external dependency.

04_ took 8 hrs to run.; 05_ won't run without modication. That's because of the different behaviors between `list.files()` in 04_ in the original computational environment (probably Windows) and Linux. The code rewrite makes the code cross-platform.

The demo code for feature extraction on Colab doesn't work because the youtube-dl  (youtube-dl 2021.12.17) doesn't work anymore to download the Tom Steyer video, or any video. Using the latest development release doesn't help.

There is an undocumented hidden steps (the creation of the `Data` directory). 

The external dependency is the UDPIPE model, which gets downloaded during the code execution. At the moment the model is still available; it would be much better to archive it. And the R package actually allows that.

The pipeline expects Linux to run 02 (glove executable). 04 uses an deprecated feature of `future`. For these two, this project should provide a Dockerfile.
