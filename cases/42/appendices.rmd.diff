 In this part of the analysis, we subset the NYT data by selecting articles containing the last names of the presidents during the study period (i.e. Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton) as a proxy of presidential news [similar to the method in @eshbaugh-soha:2010:tlp]. In total, 266,527 articles were retained. We repeated the Granger analysis and the results are listed below. The findings are very similar to the analysis of all NYT content with the exception that the LSD Net Tone emerged as significant. While this may be a real effect, it could also be a fluke. Nonetheless, as mentioned in the text, the analysis from p-hacking should not be used to support or reject any substantive theory because it proceeds in an atheoretical manner.

 Suppose the data frame `nyt` contains 2,000 news articles in the column `content` (i.e. `nyt$content`) and you want to extract the news sentiment of these articles using LSD dictionary [@Young2012].

 The criterion validity of the target value is displayed in the subplot at the top left. One should expect a strong correlation (Best practice \#2). The subplot at the bottom left displays the relationship between the target value (LSD) and article length. One should expect no correlation (Best practice \# 3).
