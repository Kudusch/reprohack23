> First, we explain what computational communication science is and why a new journal is needed for this subfield. Then, we elaborate on the type of research this journal seeks to publish, and stress the need for transparent and **reproducible science**.

> **CCR demands transparent and reproducible research**. Computational analyses require many choices regarding design, preprocessing, and parameter tuning, and transparency are needed to allow scrutiny of these choices. As digital data and analysis code can be shared easily, computational research can be at the forefront of the open science philosophy [...] Most articles in *CCR* should be accompanied by an online appendix in a form that encourages reproducibility and reusability. [...] For articles presenting substantive and/or methodological analysis results and data contributions, we expect an online research compendium published on GitHub or an equivalent service. Such a compendium contains the data, code, and results, and makes it explicit how the code is used to derive the results from the raw data.

**Challenge**: From 2019 to 2023, 47 papers have been published in the journal Computational Communication Research (CCR, the official journal of the ICA Computational Division). How computationally reproducible are the findings from these papers? Let's find out (by rerunning all shared code, if available).
